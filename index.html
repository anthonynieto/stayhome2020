<h5>March 31, 2020</h5>

<p>Hello Everybody!</p>

<p><em><strong>Social distancing</strong></em> is March&#39;s phrase of the month. Citizens across the globe locked themselves indoors in March. Most forced into isolation via Government decree as COVID-19 officially reached <em>pandemic</em>&nbsp;classification. Corporations released millions of workers or sent them home.&nbsp;Many workers now adjusting to remote work during an&nbsp;ongoing worldwide pandemic.&nbsp;Maybe workers&nbsp;will reflect,&nbsp;ponder the&nbsp;existential questions about the nature&nbsp;of work versus individual&nbsp;independence. Wonder how many will choose to leave corporate life behind in 2020.&nbsp;Perhaps more folks will move out of urban&nbsp;cities and major metropolitan suburbs for the diamonds in the rough, such as suburban&nbsp;Cleveland. Once it&#39;s safe to leave home again, perhaps we&#39;ll&nbsp;see a few more&nbsp;familiar faces out on the lake.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, for anybody new to working in your&nbsp;home for extended lengths, here are a few suggestions: (1) Stand, stretch, and walk each hour; (2) Master your water, espresso, coffee, tea, cooking, and diet capabilities; (3) Don&#39;t wear pajamas every day;&nbsp;(4) Naps are a sacred gift from the heavens; (5) Master a&nbsp;new skill&nbsp;(writing, electrical engineering, coding, piano, painting, meditation, etc.); (6) Keep contact with former co-workers you won&#39;t see face-to-face anymore.</p>

<p>For the remainder of 2020, our way of life will (and should) adjust in order to survive COVID-19. We should expect the mortality rate to surge upward in April. The virus was no hoax. It remains&nbsp;far more dangerous than the common flu or pneumonia. Even the conservative models expect the mortality rate for America in 2020 between 60,000 - 200,000 (or more). In the event that governance fails to plan and execute accordingly, we may witness the largest comprehensive public health system overload&nbsp;in American history. Special shout out to all the essential healthcare workers who have been working bravely during this historic period of time. You are true&nbsp;heroes. We are so incredibly thankful. Hope folks also keep in mind groups of <em>unseen</em>&nbsp;Americans: homeless, undocumented, uninsured, those living in extreme poverty, etc. If you have surplus economic resources during this time, please consider donating to the organization of your choosing.</p>

<p>We receive grocery delivery each week. Cook ourselves healthy meals aimed at boosting our immune system 6 - 7 days per week. On Sundays, we order delivery from our favorite restaurant(s). Continue to support our favorite small businesses even while stuck indoors. On all but two occasions in March, we have not even ventured beyond our property line. Lifting kettlebells and running miles on the treadmill in our basement. Decided to cancel our two-week trip to California. It&rsquo;s important to help keep family members (especially Grandma) and the community at large, safe. It&rsquo;s not about whether any of us can personally survive this virus -- we probably can;&nbsp;it&#39;s about protecting those less able. We as global citizens are all in this fight together. We&#39;re on the same team. Let&#39;s please do our best to help keep everybody alive.</p>

<p>Over time and certainly on nobody&rsquo;s timetable, humans will return outdoors and to work. Like the virus itself, humans study, adapt, and persist. It&rsquo;s what we do. However, 2020 will inevitably go down in the history books. Cannot help but think of the hundreds of thousands affected by the 1918 H1N1 Pandemic over a century ago. How would they react to watching us stuck in our homes with reliable electricity for washing machines and dryers and the internet with its unlimited streaming music and moving pictures on demand and our personal devices to chat with family, friends, and perfect strangers from across the world.</p>

<p>Now for notes about the financial market...</p>

<p>While citizens were so deeply focused on Coronavirus, (un)employment, personal debt, and their kid(s), most probably failed to fully grasp the magnitude of several historic events in the finance world in&nbsp;March. These are important to discuss because they are certain to impact every citizen and worker in the years ahead. First, despite actions taken by the Federal Government, the stock market bubble finally popped and we entered a bear market. Unfortunately, not before hundreds of nearly bankrupt companies with crippling debt were allowed to enter the public markets over the past few years. Hundreds of other companies (WeWork) came mere hours away from becoming public companies. The result will be massive losses for investors; some in their retirement accounts and pensions.</p>

<p>In direct response to the massive drop in the stock market, the Federal Reserve panicked and gave away tons of money. First, the Fed&nbsp;pumped&nbsp;$1.5 Trillion into banks to secure <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-06/why-the-u-s-repo-market-blew-up-and-how-to-fix-it-quicktake">repurchase agreements</a>.&nbsp;Then, while in a state of absolute panic one Sunday, the Fed announced&nbsp;they will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-slashes-interest-rates-zero-part-wide-ranging-emergency-intervention/">cut interest rates to 0%</a> for the first time AND&nbsp;purchase <em>at least</em> $700 Billion in government and mortgage-related bonds. The very next day, the Fed pumped an <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/16/fed-says-it-will-offer-an-additional-500-billion-in-overnight-repo-funding-markets.html">additional</a> </em>$500 Billion into banks. Finally, Congress rushed to pass a historic $2.2&nbsp;Trillion aid package&nbsp;called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3548/text">CARES Act</a>, which was marketed as &quot;Coronavirus relief&quot; despite willingly providing nearly $800 Billion&nbsp;for financial markets and distressed businesses. None of the actions taken by the Federal Reserve are long-term solutions but rather placing&nbsp;a band-aid on a gushing wound. It is reasonable to argue citizens, not banks or troubled companies, ought to have&nbsp;received the bulk of these&nbsp;monies. After all, who is truly responsible for corporate debt, unrealistic executive compensation packages, stagnant worker wages, and fraudulent balance sheet reporting?</p>

<p><strong>The market&nbsp;will continue to fall in March and&nbsp;April;&nbsp;potentially into summer months</strong>. We are due for a re-test of the lows established in March. Wait patiently to assess the&nbsp;damage inflicted&nbsp;in upcoming company earnings reports.&nbsp;Analysts will adjust their price targets. Funds will release their required purchase and sales filings, and so forth. Expect to watch historic weekly and monthly unemployment numbers rise, adding inevitable additional stress to the U.S. financial market. Expect to see U.S. capitalism crack further until the pandemic subsides.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to take a minute to discuss the CARES Act in a bit more detail. In the blink of an eye, Congress approved&nbsp;$2.2 Trillion in taxpayer spending.&nbsp;We saw&nbsp;0 national town hall debates&nbsp;wherein taxpayers&nbsp;could merely voice their opinions on alternative ways to spend the&nbsp;Trillions. Perhaps citizens would actually prefer to see pure&nbsp;capitalism -- let large corporations&nbsp;fail, thus giving citizens the opportunity to start their own small businesses. Perhaps citizens would instead prefer to spend Trillions on&nbsp;ending homelessness and&nbsp;poverty, ensuring&nbsp;medical insurance for all citizens, reducing costs for college education, etc.&nbsp;Instead,&nbsp;while the CARES Act marketed itself as a response to Coronavirus (in fairness, portions of it truly are), 25% of all relief, a sum total of $500 Billion, will directly benefit large corporations, many of which engaged in forms of financial recklessness and mismanagement. An additional $350 Billion is reserved for smaller businesses. Unfortunately, the CARES Act might not fully satisfy the appetite of large corporations and impacted businesses. We might see a sequel&nbsp;in 2020...and it won&rsquo;t be any prettier.</p>

<p>So, who benefits from the CARES Act?</p>

<p><u><strong>Grand Prize Winner: Large corporations</strong></u> will receive $500 Billion in loans and offerings. Consider this: large corporations including (but not limited to): Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Boeing, American Airlines, and Ford Motor Company spent over $3.5 Trillion dollars since 2010 in stock buybacks, which led to (1) an illusion of prosperity via (2) artificial price pumping&nbsp;on&nbsp;their stock price. It&rsquo;s no secret stock buybacks added major fuel to the recent market bubble. So, in March, when a significant amount of those stock buybacks fell underwater,&nbsp;those companies took a tremendous, yet long overdue, dip in stock price. Bright lights suddenly highlights shady practices. Rather than face the harsh reality of <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism, large corporations lobbied&nbsp;for bailout funding...and got it.</p>

<p><u><strong>Beneficiary: Public Health</strong></u> will receive $100 Billion in funding, a mere 20% of what large corporations will receive. Community centers which provide health care services for approximately 28 Million citizens will receive just $1.32 Billion from the CARES Act, a mere 0.264% of the amount available to impacted businesses. State and local governments are set to receive nearly $340 Billion. However, details on precisely how those funds will be&nbsp;disbursed across the nation remain scarce -&nbsp;Governors who are political allies with the current administration are receive special treatment by way of funding and medical resources, while critics receive less. Stay tuned to see how this unfolds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Participation Ribbon: Citizens</strong></u> will literally pay for years of corporate recklessness and reap few, if any, rewards. Citizens should prepare for the effects of soaring national debt and hyperinflation, as increased supply of the U.S. dollar could lead to decreases in buying power. It would be reasonable to expect the cost of goods and services in America to increase while the dollar simultaneously buys less and less with each passing month. Citizens should not be surprised if all goods and services,&nbsp;from groceries to&nbsp;healthcare providers and insurance companies, attempt to increase their prices and premiums in 2020. It could take months before we see attempts&nbsp;to increase the federal minimum wage, which has not happened in over a decade. On the bright side, it&#39;s not all bad. Some very minimal relief may temporarily be available for those in student debt. &nbsp;The new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program was created to&nbsp;expand benefits for some&nbsp;non-traditional workers. However, some limitations are likely to apply for freelancers, gig economy workers, those who make tips, etc. Some citizens might (or might not) receive between $1,200 and $4,400.</p>

<p>In the end, is a one-time check really worth it? Or does it all just seem like a cheap bribe to look the other way?</p>

<p>It&#39;s time for me to sign-off. One final note: please remember to text and call your friends and family. Make sure they&#39;re doing okay. We are living in truly historic times. Life is precious, do not take any part of it for granted.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hope April showers bring May flowers.</p>

<p>Peace &amp; love&nbsp;worldwide&nbsp;✌🏼❤️🌍</p>

<h2>February Notes</h2>

<h5>February 29, 2020</h5>

<p>Happy Saturday &amp;&nbsp;Leap Day! Longer post this month. Grab a bite or drink&nbsp;and let&rsquo;s go.</p>

<p><em><strong>Coronavirus</strong></em>&nbsp;(COVID-19) is the word of the month. Viral epidemics are nothing new. In the past two decades we&nbsp;survived West Nile Virus, Zika, SARS, Avian Flu (H5N1), Swine Flu (H1N1), and so forth. Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the latest viral strain to avoid. One cannot help but gain healthy appreciation for the elegant evolution shown by these complex&nbsp;living organisms in their pursuit to survive.</p>

<p>Coronavirus cases will increase at least&nbsp;in the short-term. China&rsquo;s CDC, in conjunction with their National Health Commission (NHC) provides reasonably detailed, transparent,&nbsp;<a href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/news/TrackingtheEpidemic.htm">daily summaries</a>. Remember to take anything the Chinese Government says with a grain of salt; since they&#39;re a hotbed for censorship. On average, 400 new cases per day, nearly 80,000 total cases, approximately 3.5% fatal rate. Some reports note fatal rate as low as 0.2% in ideal circumstances where patients are&nbsp;healthy with no underlying conditions in the&nbsp;10-39 age bracket. Similarly, the U.S. Center For Disease Control&nbsp;(CDC) provides the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6908e1.htm?s_cid=mm6908e1_w">MMWR</a>). Prefer public health&nbsp;sources compared to louder cable news&nbsp;commentary. Cautious of officials with legislative /&nbsp;executive power&nbsp;who would be more inclined to&nbsp;weaponize Coronovirus rhetoric for political malfeasance. On the social level, racism could intensify in local communities while Coronavirus spreads. Hope we&#39;re all diligent enough to immediately correct any such discrimination.&nbsp;Coronavirus is bad enough&nbsp;without additional undue&nbsp;pain, suffering, and long-lasting scars.</p>

<p>Several stories in major <a href="https://dc.eater.com/2020/2/26/21154257/coronavirus-dc-chinese-restaurants-peter-chang-rockville-fairfax">metropolitan</a> <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/24/lifestyle/eating-time-coronavirus/">cities</a>&nbsp;report&nbsp;local businesses in the Chinese community declined 20% - 80% percent. In Cleveland, the Chinese food scene is comparatively&nbsp;small but we are&nbsp;blessed with many delicious&nbsp;restaurants. Our date nights are now happy acts of community support for these smaller entrepreneurs. We value them, we enjoy them, we want them to thrive for a long time. <strong>In the current climate, it&rsquo;s a noble act to walk into your favorite Szechuan, Hunan, Xi&rsquo;an, etc. restaurant and smile, ask to be seated, and simply enjoy some of the most delicious food on the planet.</strong></p>

<p>Now, for something completely different...</p>

<p>Substantial scope of audio experiments in February. Dozens of sample-based compositions, with emphasis on percussion; cymbals in orchestra, cymbals in world instruments, and cymbals in modern production. Drums. Lots of drums. Here&rsquo;s why: the passing of Neil Peart &amp; Sean Reinert&nbsp;inspired me to focus more deeply on drums and percussion. When someone is deceased, an effective coping mechanism is to fill the void they leave behind by developing the parts we&#39;d inevitably miss most. The thunderous drumming on &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzvtfbqJeIY&amp;t=783s">Secret Face</a>&rdquo; and cymbal work with synthesizers from&nbsp;&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzvtfbqJeIY&amp;t=1566s">Cosmic Sea</a>&rdquo; altered the perception of what my 9-10 year old brain at that time believed metal&nbsp;sounded like way back in 1992-1993. Luckily, we live in a golden&nbsp;era for&nbsp;recording technology, wherein&nbsp;I&#39;m now writing pieces exclusive to Sean&#39;s drumming <a href="https://www.toontrack.com/product/deathlike-fusion-midi/">articulations</a>. Needless to say, reminded&nbsp;of Chuck Schuldiner constantly&nbsp;while listening to Sean Reinert.</p>

<p>Similarly, the drumming on Rush&rsquo;s &ldquo;Subdivisions&rdquo;, specifically the intricate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYYdQB0mkEU&amp;t=124">ride bell patterns</a> during the interlude portion,&nbsp;remains my favorite moment of any Rush song or album, hands down -- a simple ride bell pattern -- cannot overstate the impact that ride bell pattern and cymbal work on a single Rush song had on me. The legend of Neil Peart extends far beyond drumming alone!&nbsp;All this&nbsp;to say that while analyzing modern production, particularly for cymbals and percussion. It came as a shock to hear <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkIT6CApgqQ">producers</a>&nbsp;(still adore Rick B.) and musicians, mostly in the comments sections, so miffed&nbsp;by these loud hi-hat in modern trap music or state it &ldquo;adds nothing to the groove&rdquo;. Younger generations think differently; perhaps they require an aggressive, loud,&nbsp;hi-hat to be inspired.&nbsp;Regardless, my adoration for the rapid, complex, ride cymbal pattern from Rush&rsquo;s Subdivisions makes it extremely easy for me to understand the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H7FwC52vhk">younger</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OX5T813nWo">generation&rsquo;s</a> enthusiasm for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv2XnbQA_SY">hi-hat rolls</a> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0U7SxXHkPY">modern</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYc95vB-nT4">trap</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYc95vB-nT4">music</a> production. While the trap hi-hats haven&rsquo;t (in my opinion) risen, yet, to the level of awesomeness as Neil Peart&rsquo;s ride cymbal patterns or how modern <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyXvmX0BXlM&amp;t=181">metal</a> drummers employ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjcavNCQ7dU&amp;t=102">cymbals</a> for creative chaos, it&rsquo;s rather silly for music-makers&nbsp;to trash the&nbsp;modern spicing of a vintage musical dish. Let&#39;s remember to keep an open mind. <strong>In art especially, sometimes we have to force our mind open,&nbsp;invite something brand new in and&nbsp;hang out with it for awhile, in order to appreciate it.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>March on!<br />

<h2>Updates &amp; Frequency</h2>

<h5>January 31, 2020</h5>

<p>Happy Friday!</p>

<p>Took one week to decide <em>monthly</em> is the best frequency for updates here; not weekly or daily. Allows for deeper daily focus, silent reflection, extended ruminations, and unclogs timelines. Commemorative posts the last day of each month. Over time, longer essays, photos, music, etc.</p>

<p>Major focus on cardio, weight lifting, and diet. Healthiest lifestyle (for me) in 20+ years. Vowing to be in peak health / shape for our wedding.</p>

<p>Attended small coding meetup; reminded of startup life. Refreshed, invigorated, and inspired. Finished coding a Python-based webapp for investments &amp; trading. Plan to share for free public use sometime in the next few months.</p>

<p>Collected fresh variety of gear for third album. Will experiment heavily with new timbres. Literal decades of ideas still fresh to record. Aim to be limitless.</p>

<p>Several high-profile deaths in January, Coronavirus, and Impeachment hearings. Hope global public internalizes the trauma and outputs progress &amp; beauty from it all. Worst case scenario is abstract bad news into mere headlines and forget, further diverge into tribalisms, and / or grow apathetic. Even during the darkest times, there remains mountains of inspiration we can traverse, fields of progress ready to cultivate.</p>

<p>Cheers, let&#39;s crush it in February!<br />

<h2>Farewell 2010s</h2>

<h5>December 31, 2019</h5>

<p>The final day of 2019. The final day of the decade. Farewell to the 10s!</p>

<p>2010s began as a kid leaving YouTube. Walked into a little startup called <span style="color:#00acee">Twitter</span>; employee ~100 (give or take) hoping to make an impact on the internet industry. The decade ends with me working for myself, outside both tech and my native <span style="color:gold">California</span>.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, hunkered down to build a trading algorithm; finished a few coding courses along the way, including <span style="color:crimson">Harvard&#39;s</span> Computer Science 50 course. Literally having dreams about code across C, Python, SQL, etc. The course <a href="https://certificates.cs50.io/0b690321-66fb-4788-8d14-6aa31ebc7144.png" target="_blank">certificate</a> is a true badge of honor.</p>

<p>The course itself is worth a blog entry or two, but most importantly, the course inspired me to (slowly) cease posting to Twitter &amp; Facebook. Prefer to build personal micro-technologies to express trading, music, and technology. A simple blog propels me toward the goal.</p>

<p>2020s will include venturing outside my hermit shell to meet some new folks. Got a wave of new music to record. May write another book, will certainly get married. Would love to build public trader resources. Technology meetups here-and-there sound great, too. Cheers to the next decade!</p>
